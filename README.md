# BGEMBJATWDHATBTGIA

 A game [@JoostdeJager](https://github.com/joostdejager) and I made when we where 16 for a school project
 
 ## The game
 
 It's a (very) short platformer game. You jump from platform to platform in between rocks and lava.
 
 ## The title
 You might also be wondering: What does the title of this game mean? Well it's a long name.
 The title stands for:
**B**est **G**ame **E**ver **M**ade **B**y **J**oost **A**nd **T**essa **W**e **D**idn't **H**ave **A** **T**itle **B**ut **T**he **G**ame **I**s **A**wesome
